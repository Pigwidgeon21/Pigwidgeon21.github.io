      <p> "Some people create with words or with music or with a brush and paints. I like to make something beautiful when I run. I like to make people stop and say, 'I've never seen anyone run like that before.' It's more than just a race, it's a style.
        It's doing something better than anyone else. It's being creative."-Steve Prefontaine
